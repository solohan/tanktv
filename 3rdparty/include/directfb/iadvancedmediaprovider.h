 * It is retrieved with IDirectFB::GetInterface() with the following specific parameters:
 * - type = "AdvancedMediaProvider" (AMP)
 * - arg = (void *)sourceID - a number between 0 and #MAX_AMP_INSTANCES identifying the new AMP instance.
 *
 * After an AMP instance is instantiated, a specific media (of explicit or autodetected type) can be assigned to it
 * through a IAdvancedMediaProvider::OpenMedia() call, its presentation can be initiated through a IAdvancedMediaProvider::StartPresentation()
 * or IAdvancedMediaProvider::StartPresentationTo() call and then it can be controlled interactivelly through 
 * IAdvancedMediaProvider::PostPresentationCmd() / IAdvancedMediaProvider::ExecutePresentationCmd() / IAdvancedMediaProvider::UploadStatusChanges() calls.
 *
 * One AMP instance encapsulates one instance of the available \ref controlimpl that coresponds to the type of the media assigned to the AMP.
 *
 * The AMP instances with the first #MAX_VIDEO_AMP_INSTANCES sourceID values are assigned the available DirectFB video layers
 * (sourceID values #MAIN_VIDEO_AMP_ID and #SECONDARY_VIDEO_AMP_ID are mapped on the video layers #EM86LAYER_MAINVIDEO and #EM86LAYER_SECVIDEO respectively).
 * Instances with other sourceID values can not display video directly; they can be used for:
 * - video-only media with video rendered to a DirectFB surface using IAdvancedMediaProvider::StartPresentationTo() method
 * - interactive audio media (type #MTYPE_ELEM_PCM | #MTYPE_APP_BDJ)
 * - opening complex media (DVDs, etc) for examination only (without calling IAdvancedMediaProvider::StartPresentation() or IAdvancedMediaProvider::StartPresentationTo())
 *
 * All the AMP instances with presentations active in the same time must use different sourceID values.
 * A presentation is active between the StartPresentation() call and the IAdvancedMediaProvider::CloseMedia() or IAdvancedMediaProvider::Release() calls.
 * Using the same sourceID for multiple concurrent AMP instances is usefull if the underlying DCC-HD playback control class
 * supports pre-buffering - medias can be opened in advance and, by the time they are serially presented, they have accumulated
 * data so they can start the presentation immediatelly. In this case, the pre-buffered AMPs must use the same sourceIDs
 * in order to use the same system resources. For details on prebuffering, see DCCHD_MONO::CMonoNavigator class documentation.
 *
